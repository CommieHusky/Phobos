# phobos
MoF starter shmup project

## Developer Setup

[Download openframeworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/) and extract the zip file to a directory on your hard drive.

Follow the [Visual Studio Setup Guide](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/) to install the openFrameworks extension for
Visual Studio 2015. **NOTE:** openFrameworks _isn't supported past VS 2015_ but the setup guide has a download link for
the community edition of VS 2015 for your convenience.

Clone the repository into the `myApps` directory of your openFrameworks installation. For example, if you extracted
openFrameworks to `C:\openFrameworks`, the directory for your cloned repository should be
`C:\openFrameworks\apps\myApps\phobos\`. If you try to open the project from any other location, Visual Studio will complain
that it can't load openFrameworks when you try to open the project!

You will also need to install the [ofxDatGui](http://braitsch.github.io/ofxDatGui/) addon, a community add-on. Basically,
clone the repository into the `addons` directory of your openFrameworks installation.

You should now be ready to open the project in Visual Studio 2015.
